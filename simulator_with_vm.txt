It seems using a VM for running the simulator is an option really interesting.

Next some steps for installing the Slurm simulator on a Ubuntu-12.04.1 Linux system.

This has been tested under VMware.

1) Get the DVD ISO image for Ubuntu-12.04.1
2) Using VMware, create a new virtual machines using the ISO image previously downloaded
	- Use user 'tester' with password 'slurm' as the default user

3) Once you have the VM running the Ubuntu after installation, you need to install these packages:

	you can get root being user 'tester' just doing a sudo bash with 'tester' password

	apt-get install mysql-server-5.5 (use user 'root' with password 'slurm' for mysql user)
	apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
	apt-get install libssl-dev
	apt-get install libhwloc-dev


4) As user tester, Create a directory named SIMULATOR on your home directory

5) As user tester, copy file sim_test_dir.tar.bz2 to the SIMULATOR directory of your Linux running in the VM and follow instructions from the INSTALL file found inside the tar file.
